# DND Custom Stores
 
This is a soon-to-be website for making custom stores for DnD. Users can create DnD-games and make itemlists, tiers, enchantments and unique items for stores all around the DnD-world. The website will generate item pools for stores in the DnD-world based on these parameters. Idea is to give the user control on what the probabilities are for each itemtier. For example we can have a store with the following probabilities:

**Rarity** | **Probability**
-----------|-----------
Common | 44 %
Uncommon | 25 %
Rare | 15%
Very rare | 10 %
Legendary | 5 %
Unique | 1%
